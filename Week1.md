### Compiler vs Interpreter:
- Compiler needs entire program to be loaded in RAM while interpreter loads just one line into buffer
- Compiler is faster than interpreter 
- Memory requirement for interpreter is very low (Usually used in memory constrained devices)
- Explore : Which runs faster - Compiled code or interpreted code ? 
- JIT compilers are between the two and more efficient

### Imperative vs Declarative:


### Role of Data types in programming languages


### Static vs Dynamic typing
- In static typing the type of a variable is declared in advance
- In dynamic typing the type of a variable is determined by its current value
